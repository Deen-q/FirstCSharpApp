# FirstCSharpApp
Hi, thanks for visiting. This is a very, very simple app to help find my way around C# and Azure. This will underpin a future fullstack project employing TDD and GitHub Actions.
<br>
<br>
<b>End goal (for this 'warm-up' app):</b> use Azure Storage Emulator and Explorer to queue messages. The queued messages should then trigger a local Azure function, leading to a log to the console.
<br>
<br>
## Progress log (most recent on top):
- Hiatus until January - need something more 'low impact' this holiday season to prevent the very real threat of burnout. This will be in the form of the C# professional certification offered my Microsoft x freecodecamp. The 'go slow to go fast' approach would be more effective here, much to my dismay...! It will help solidify all of the foundations and help me edge away from the likes of multi-layered abstraction (e.g., React). <b>This project will also underpin my future TDD project (with full CI/CD), with a TypeScript or vanilla JS front end (+ CSS and other ways to style) and a C# SQL backend! Stay tuned...</b>
- Still not much progress worth pushing. Not so much with the C# syntax, but more so navigating through Visual Studio and understanding principles (SOLID, MVC etc).
- Getting Azure Storage Explorer to help enqueue messages. No luck so far, neither with the command line.
- Running the code does work somewhat: received logs of timestamped messages every 1 minute (I did this to see if code itself was the problem - it correctly recieves messages. Just need the queue).
